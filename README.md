# Home SOC & Self-Hosted Lab Project

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity lab and self-hosted infrastructure documentation. This space serves as a living portfolio of my hands-on journey into network security, system administration, and cloud integration.

## 🌐 Project Scope

This lab simulates a small business SOC and enterprise environment. I'm learning by doing — building, breaking, and defending in real time. Key components include:

- **pfSense Firewall** running on a Jetway mini PC with a 5-port NIC
- **VLAN segmentation** for better traffic isolation and control
- **Windows Server 2019** running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- **Suricata IDS/IPS** implementation
- **(Planned)** Splunk for log management, SIEM, and monitoring
- **Self-hosted personal website**
- **Remote access via VPN** (testing OpenVPN and WireGuard)
- **GitHub repo** for all documentation, configs, and updates

## 📊 Why I'm Doing This

I'm actively transitioning into a career in cybersecurity, with a focus on cloud security and infrastructure hardening. This project demonstrates my:
- Problem-solving under fire 🔥
- Understanding of core IT concepts (networking, identity, endpoint security)
- Ability to document and share complex setups clearly

## 🔧 Current Progress

- ✅ pfSense installed on Jetway device
- ✅ VLAN planning initiated
- ✅ DNS and repo troubleshooting completed
- 🔄 Working on package manager error resolution
- 🔜 Active Directory domain controller
- 🔜 VPN remote access
- 🔜 Suricata & Splunk deployment

## 📁 Folder Structure (coming soon)

I'll maintain structured directories for:
- Config files
- Network diagrams
- Setup scripts
- How-to guides
- Security findings
